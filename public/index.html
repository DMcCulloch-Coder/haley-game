                        the question to them, they will then have to answer the
                        question to their best ability if they get it right the card
                        says what they can do, if they get it wrong then they will
                        have to roll the six-sided dice and move back however

                    <h3>Playing the Whole Game:</h3>
                    <p>
                        First playing chooses someone to grab the top card for them and 
                        that player reads the card out loud and the first player must 
                        try their hardest to answer the question if they get it right 
                        they do what the card says to do if the player gets it wrong 
                        then they have to roll a  six-sided dice and move back however 
                        many times it says to and do that action if they land on a place 
                        that they want to buy they can buy it for how much it says on 
                        the placemat, However, if someone owns that place you have to 
                        pay a $50 fee and the next player does the same thing. 

                        The game ends when every place is sold and the person with 
                        the most places wins.
